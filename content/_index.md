## Background

Since February 2026, I am working as a Software Engineer at Google Warsaw.

In June 2025, I obtained a **[Master's Degree](https://www.uu.nl/en/masters/game-and-media-technology)** in Computer Science *cum laude* from Utrecht University. **[My thesis](https://studenttheses.uu.nl/handle/20.500.12932/48903)**, titled "Finding dense and well-shaped convex clusters in 2-dimensional point sets", addressed the problem of computing a convex region with bounded area and diameter that contains the maximum number of points from a given set. In collaboration with my supervisors Marc van Kreveld, Frank Staals, and Sjoerd de Vries, we designed, implemented, and tested a novel geometric algorithm that solves this problem in O(n⁶k) time and O(n³k) space. This work has been **[published](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/entities/document/10.4230/LIPIcs.ESA.2025.23)** in the volume **[33rd Annual European Symposium on Algorithms (ESA 2025)](https://algo-conference.org/2025/)** on October 1st, 2025. On September 12th 2025, I had the chance to **[present](https://getgianmarco.com/slides_warsaw.pdf)** our work at ESA ALGO 2025 in Warsaw. While working on my thesis, I also participated in the **[Utrecht University Business Course (UUBC)](https://uubc.nl/)**, a 12-week honours programme selected for the top 30 Master's students university-wide seeking practical experience in entrepreneurship and consultancy.

From June 2021 to July 2022, I worked as a Junior Software Engineer at Ubisoft Milan. There, I was part of the AI development team for **[Mario+Rabbids: Sparks of Hope](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/mario-rabbids/sparks-of-hope)**, which was released on the Nintendo Switch in October 2022. I had the opportunity to collaborate within a multinational team spanning multiple Ubisoft studios worldwide. It was an incredible experience to learn from highly talented colleagues and see my work have a tangible impact on players.

In December 2020, I earned a **[Bachelor’s Degree](https://corsidilaurea.uniroma1.it/en/course/33503)** in Computer Science *cum laude* from Sapienza University of Rome. **[My thesis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GF-0lmLa5gIGnhr-LqiDNZ9qDCWMyoD4/view?usp=sharing)**, titled "Functional programming: computational analysis of algorithms generating semi-infinite data-structures", analyzed the performance of several functional algorithms written in Haskell for prime number generation. Together with my supervisor, Ivano Salvo, we established asymptotic upper bounds and experimentally verified the performance of such algorithms.

Between September 2016 and July 2017, alongside my final year of high school in Nettuno, I completed a **[course](https://www.aiv01.it/corsi/accademici/video-game-programming/)** in videogame programming at the Italian Videogame Academy (AIV) in Rome. The curriculum included advanced lectures on C#, computer graphics, and Unreal Engine 4.
